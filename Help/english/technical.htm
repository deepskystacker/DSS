All the offsets and rotation angles are computed relative to this reference 
frame.<br>
<br>
The offsets are rotation angles are computed by identifying patterns of stars in 
the frames.<br>
To put it simply the algorithm is looking for the largest triangles of which the 
side distances (and so the angles between the sides) are the closest.<br>
When a sufficient number of such triangles is detected between the reference 
frame and the frame to be aligned the offsets and rotation are computed and 
validated using the least square method.<br>
Depending of the number of stars a bisquared of bilinear transformation is used.<br>

</b>You shot the same subject two nights in a row. <br>

To associate each Light Frame with the good Dark and Flat Frames you just need 
to put all the Light+Dark+Flat Frames from the first night in one File Group and 
all the Light+Dark+Flat Frames of the second night in another File Group.<br>
Since Offset/Bias Frames are common to all the nights they must be put in the <i>

stacking process of DeepSkyStacker is very classical.<br>
<b>Step 1<br>
</b>Creation of the master offset from all the offset frames (with the selected 
method).<br>
If more than one offset frame is checked, a master offset is created as 
MasterOffset_ISOxxx.tif (TIFF 8, 16 or 32 bit) in the folder of the first offset frame.<br>
This file may be used as the only offset frame the next time.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 2<br>
</b>Creation of the master dark from all the dark frames (with the selected 
method). The master offset is 
subtracted from each dark frame.<br>
If more than one dark frame is checked, a master dark is created as 
MasterDark_ISOxxx_yyys.tif (TIFF 8, 16 or 32 bit) in the folder of the first dark frame.<br>
This file may be used as the only dark frame the next time.<br>
<br>
Creation of the master dark flat from all the dark flat frames (with the selected 
method). The master offset is 
subtracted from each dark flat frame.<br>
If more than one dark flat frame is checked, a master dark flat is created as MasterDarkFlat_ISOxxx_yyys.tif (TIFF 8, 16 or 32 bit) in the folder of the first dark 
flat frame.<br>
This file may be used as the only dark flat frame the next time.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 3<br>
</b>Creation of the master flat from all the flat frames (with the selected 
method). The master offset and dark flat are 
subtracted from each flat frame. The master flat is automatically calibrated.<br>
If more than one flat frame is checked, a master flat is created as 
MasterFlat_ISOxxx.tif (TIFF 8, 16 or 32 bit) in the folder of the first flat frame.<br>
This file may be used as the only flat frame the next time.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4<br>
</b>Computing of all offsets and rotations for all the light frames that will be 
stacked.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 5<br>
</b>Creation of the final picture by adding all the light frames with the 
selected method. <br>
The master 
offset and the master dark are automatically subtracted from each light frame and the result 
is divided by the calibrated master flat, then if the option is enabled the hot 
pixels detected in the dark frame are removed and the value is interpolated from 
neighbors..<br>
<br>
<b>Step 6<br>
</b>When the
<A style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: blue; text-underline: single" href="#bayerdrizzle">Bayer drizzle</A> is enabled, the three RGB components are normalized to avoid 
the information's holes.<br>

</b><font face="Arial" size="2">This is the simplest method. The mean of all the pixels in the stack is 
computed for each pixel.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#800000">Median</font><br>

<b><font color="#800000">Maximum</font><br>
</b>This is and ultra simple method which should be use with a lot of care. The 
maximum value of all the pixels in the stack is computed for each pixel.<br>
It may be useful to find what is wrong in a stack by exhibiting all the defects 
of all the calibrated images.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#800000">Kappa-Sigma Clipping</font><br>
</b>This method is used to reject deviant pixels iteratively.<br>
Two parameters are used: the number of iterations and the standard deviation 
multiplier used (Kappa).<br>
For each iteration, the mean and standard deviation (Sigma) of the pixels in the 
stack are computed.<br>
Each pixel which value is farthest from the mean than more than Kappa * 
Sigma is rejected.<br>
The mean of the remaining pixels in the stack is computed for each pixel.</font></p>

This weighted average is adapted from the work of Dr. Peter

Techniques of Least Squares and Stellar Photometry with CCDs</A>&nbsp;- Peter B. 
Stetson 1989).<br>
This method computes a robust average obtained by iteratively weighting each 
pixel from the deviation from the mean comparatively to the standard deviation.<br>
<br>
<font color="#800000"><b>Entropy Weighted Average (High Dynamic Range)</b></font><br>
This method is based on the work of German, Jenkin and Lesperance (<a target="_blank" href="http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/CRV.2005.38">see 
Entropy-Based image merging - 2005</a>) and is used to stack the picture while 
keeping for each pixel the best dynamic.<br>
It is particularly useful when stacking pictures taken with different exposure 
times and ISO speeds, and it creates an averaged picture with the best possible 
dynamic. To put it simply it avoids burning galaxies and nebula centers.<br>
Note: this method is very CPU and memory intensive.</font></p>

    <b>What and when you need to use the drizzle option</b><br>
    Basically you need only to have a lot of images which must not be perfectly 
    aligned (a few pixels drift is enough). <br>
    It makes no sense to 
    drizzle if you have only a few light frames.<br>
    <br>
    Drizzling is particularly good at enhancing the resolution so it is very 
    useful when shooting small objects with a short focal length.<br>
    <br>
    On the right is a example of an almost unprocessed M57 (shot using a 10", F/D  
    4.72 OTA with a Canon DSLR).<br>
    <br>
    Usually M57 is very small, but by using a 2x drizzle and around 100 light 
    frames the resulting image is twice bigger and the resolution is much 
    better.<br>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Side effects of drizzling</b><br>
The main side effect is that the amount of memory and disk space necessary to 
create and process drizzled images is multiplied by the square of the Drizzle 
factor. Of course the time needed to create such images is also much longer.<br>
<br>
For example, using a 2x Drizzle with 3000x2000 pixel images will create a 
6000x4000 pixel image, which will need 4 times the memory and disk space size, 
and will be much longer to create.<br>
<br>
When using the 3x Drizzle option, everything is multiplied by 9 (3 squared) and 
unless you have a very powerful machine and a lot of memory and disk space 
available you don't want to use this on classic DSLR images.<br>
<br>
However, on some small images (like the one created by the first DSI and LPI 
cameras), it could make  sense to use the 3x Drizzle option to enhance the 
resolution.<br>
<br>
A good way to limit the increase of memory and disk space necessary to use the 
Drizzle option is to use a <A href="#customrect">Custom Rectangle</A>.<br>

<b>Drizzle and Bayer Drizzle</b><br>
Although they are using  two flavors of the Drizzle method, it is not 
recommended to use the Drizzle and Bayer Drizzle option together.<br>

<b>Mixing Comet and non Comet images</b><br>
DeepSkyStacker can use images with a registered comet and images without a

nebula for example).</font></p>

Obviously the most demanding algorithm is the Comet and Stars stacking leading 
to the star freeze effect.<br>
Slow moving comets are leading to hard to detect large objects or big stars and 
in this case the comet extraction process may be less than perfect.<br>
In all cases, if you take a set of images from the same area without the comet

</span></b><span lang="EN-US" style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
First, a small reminder of what is the Bayer matrix<br>
When you are using an 8 mega-pixels DSLR, the CMOS or CCD chip is a black and 
white chip of 8 mega-pixels on which is glued a Bayer matrix which is in fact a 
pattern of RGBG or CYMK filters in front of each pixel (other patterns are 
possible) <br>
<br>
In the case of RGBG filters a fourth of the pixels are capturing
<span style="COLOR: red">red</span>, another fourth <span style="COLOR: blue">blue</span> 
and the remaining half <span style="COLOR: green">green</span>.<br>
So your 8 mega-pixels DSLR is producing pictures with 2 millions red pixels, the 
same amount of blue pixels and 4 millions green pixels.<br>
<br>
Then how the DSLR is creating "true" colors pictures?<br>
Very simply by interpolating the missing primary colors from neighboring pixels.
