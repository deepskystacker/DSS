The answer is simple: only to increase the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).</font><br>

Is the resulting image more colorful? No.<br>

The goal of combing many images into one is only to increase the SNR. The 
resulting images are neither more luminous or more colorful but they contain 
much less noise which will let you stretch the histogram a lot more which will 
give you more freedom to bring back colors and details.</font></font></p>

How many frames</font></b><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#ff0000" size="4">?</font><font size="2"><br>
The more, the better but above some threshold it is less efficient.</font><br>
</b><font size="2">The signal to noise ration in increasing with the square root 
of the number of combined frames regardless of the exposure time of each frame.<br>
This is true with all the combining methods (average, median, kappa-sigma 
clipping, auto-adaptive weighted average, ...) except entropy weighted average 
since this one in using the entropy to weight each pixel and thus is increasing 
the noise that is a big entropy contributor.</font></font><font face="Arial" size="2">.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">This means that if your base SNR is 1, when you 
combine 10 images the SNR increases by 3.16 (square root of 10). For 30 images 
it is 5.47, for 50 images it is 7.07, for 100 images it is 10, for 300 images it 
is 17.32.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">As you can see to gain a 7 ratio 50 frames are 
needed between 1 and 50, but 200 frames are needed above 100.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Are 100 x 1 minute and 
10x10 minutes giving the same result?</b><br>
Yes when considering the SNR but definitely No when considering the final result.<br>
the difference between a 10 minutes exposure and a 1 minute exposure is that the 
SNR in the 10 minutes exposure is 3.16 higher than in 1 minute exposure.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus you will get the same SNR if you combine 10 
light frames of 10 minutes or 100 light frames of 1 minute. However you will 
probably not have the same signal (the interesting part). Simply put you will 
only get a signal if your exposure is long enough to catch some photons on most 
of the light frames so that the signal is not considered as noise.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">For example for a very faint nebula you might get 
a few photons every 10 minutes. If you are using 10 minutes exposures, you will 
have captured photons on each of your light frames and when combined the signal 
will be strong. <br>
If you are using 1 minute exposures you will capture photons only for some of 
your light frames and when combined the photons will be considered as noise 
since they are not in most of the light frames.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Can I combine two (or more) resulting images?<br>
</b>Absolutely, the square root rule applies with a small twist.<br>
<br>
When combining two images the SNR increases by 1.414 (square root of 2).<br>
If both images have the same SNR then this is the same as doing a single stack. 
That does not mean that the combination is giving the same image, just that the 
SNR will be the same.<br>
<br>
However if one stack contains more light frames than the other, the SNR of the 
two stacks will be different and the SNR of the combination will be lower than 
the SNR of a single stack containing all the light frames.<br>
<br>
Thus by combining the result of a 10x1 minute stack with a single 1 minute frame 
the SNR is roughly the same as the one obtained by combining 2 light frames. 
This is due to the fact that when combining two images the noise is additive and 
the best image is damaged by the worse image in the process.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="Calibration"></a>C</font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000" size="4">alibration: 
how to use dark, flat and bias frames<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The calibration is the process consisting 
in subtracting the bias and dark signals and dividing by the flat signal.<br>
The goal here is not to explain how to take dark, bias and flat frames (see
<A href="faq.htm#lightdarkflatoffset">here</A>) but to better understand how to 
use them to get the best possible images.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A good idea</b><br>
Everybody is saying that you must take dark, bias and flat frames to create 
great images, but if you are doing it the wrong way you can easily damage your 
nice light frames ending up with very disappointing results.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">The good news is that it is really easy to get 
nice results. Here is why and how.<br>
<br>
<b>A common misconception</b><br>
It is a common misconception to think that the number of dark, bias and flat 
frames is related to the number of light frames.<br>
A lot of people are using very few (sometimes even only one) dark, bias and flat 
frames while they could get much better results by using a large number of dark, 
bias and flat frames with the same set of light frames.<br>
<br>
Following the square root rule you will have much cleaner masters if you use a 
lot of frames to create them. Remember that you are trying to remove the dark 
and bias signals, not the noise that is coming with it. <br>
<br>
For example when you subtract the master dark from each light frame you are 
adding the noise of the master dark to the noise of the light frame. The smaller 
the noise of the master dark, the less noise you will add to the light frame. 
This is also true for the master bias and the master flat.<br>
<br>
In fact by using only a very small number of frames for the creation of the 
masters you can easily triple the noise of the calibrated light frame (bias and 
dark subtracted and flat divided) compared to the noise of the light frame 
before calibration. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">You will then need 9 times (3 squared) more light 
frames to bring back the noise to the level you could have had by using noise 
free masters.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">This is the reason why you should use as many 
dark/bias/flat frames as possible. On the practical side, 20 frames is a minimum 
if you want to not add too much noise, and 50 to 100 will give you really nice 
and (almost) noise free masters..<br>
<br>
<b>A side note about hot pixels</b><br>
Hot pixels are pixels that are not behaving normally. They are a very strong 
signal that is visible in each dark and each light frame. <br>
<br>
Of course when you subtract one dark frame to one light frame you will remove 
the hot pixels which may give the false impression that the dark subtraction did 
its job. <br>
However, at the same time the subtraction doubled the noise of the calibrated 
light frame and ruined it thoroughly.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="ISOSpeed"></a></font>
<font face="Arial" color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>Which ISO speed?<br>
</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2">The question is common enough and the 
answer is simple: it doesn't matter...sort of.<br>
<br>
In fact the ISO speed is just a setting of any DSLR, but since the CMOS or CCD 
chip is the same (you don't change it when changing the ISO speed, do you?) then 
the results are really the same.<br>
This is not because you are using a higher ISO speed that you get more photons, 
it's just that the signal is more amplified (noise and all).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">The good news is that you don't 
need to change the ISO speed to try to capture a fainter target. You just need 
to take longer exposures.<br>
<br>
Of course it's a little more complicated than that since there is a good ISO 
speed for each DSLR.<br>
However it depends on the characteristics of each sensor chip (readout noise and 
electronic noise) and is not simple to compute.<br>
Christian Buil has computed the values for a few Canon DSLRs</font></p>
