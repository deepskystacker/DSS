Light Frames<br>
</b><font size="2">The Light Frames are the images that contains the real 
information: images of galaxies, nebula...<br>
This is what you want to stack.<br>
<br>
</font><b>Dark Frames and Dark Flat Frames<br>
</b><font size="2">The Dark Frames are used to remove the dark signal from the 
light frames (or the flat frames for the Dark Flat frames).<br>
With DSLRs and CCD Camera, the CMOS or CCD is generating a dark signal depending 
of the exposure time, temperature and ISO speed (DSLR only).<br>
To remove the dark signal from the light frames you use a dark frame that 
contains only the dark signal.<br>
<br>
The best way to create the dark frames is to shoot pictures in the dark (hence 
the name) by covering the lens.<br>
The dark frames must be created with the exposure time, temperature and ISO 
speed of the light frames (resp. flat frames).<br>
Since the temperature is important try to shoot dark frames at the end or during 
your imaging session.<br>
<br>
Take a few of them (between 10 and 20 is usually enough). DeepSkyStacker will 
combine them automatically to create and use a clean master dark or master dark 
flat.<br>
<br>
</font><b>Bias Frames (aka Offset Frames)<br>
</b><font size="2">The Bias/Offset Frames are used to remove the CCD or CMOS 
chip readout signal from the light frames.<br>
Each CCD or CMOS chip is generating a readout signal which is a signal created 
by the electronic just by reading the content of the chip.<br>
<br>
It's very easy to create bias/offset frames: just take the shortest possible 
exposure (it may be 1/4000s or 1/8000s depending on your camera) in the dark by 
covering the lens.<br>
The bias frames must be create with the ISO speed of the light frames. The 
temperature is not important.<br>
<br>
Take a few of them (between 10 and 20 is usually enough). DeepSkyStacker will 
combine them automatically to create and use a clean master bias/offset frame<br>
<br>
</font><b>Flat Frames<br>
</b><font size="2">The Flat Frames are used to correct the vignetting and uneven 
field illumination created by dust or smudges in your optical train.<br>
<br>
To create good flat frames it is very important to <u><b>not</b></u> remove your 
camera from your telescope before taking them (including not changing the 
focus).<br>
You can use a lot of different methods (including using a flatbox) but I found 
that the simplest way is to put a white T shirt in front of your telescope and&nbsp; 
smooth out the folds. Then shoot something luminous (a flash, a bright white 
light, the sky at dawn...) and let the camera decide of the exposure time (Av 
mode), <br>
<br>
The flat frames should be created with the ISO speed of the light frames. The 
temperature is not important.<br>
<br>
Take a few of them (between 10 and 20 is usually enough). DeepSkyStacker will 
combine them automatically to create and use a clean master flat frame.</font></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-gb"><font size="2">
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><b>Is it possible to use colored flat frames?</b><br>
The short answer is yes.<br>
The overall tint of your flat frames is not really important because 
DeepSkyStacker is processing each channel separately and is applying the flat 
frames to each channel accordingly.<br>
Of course if your flat frames are fully red only the red channel of your light 
frames will be properly calibrated but otherwise as long as as the peak in each 
channel is between 1/3 and 2/3 of the maximum you should have no problem using 
slightly colored flat frames.</span></font></span></p>

DeepSkyStacker is only supporting uncompressed TIFF files or LZW and ZIP 
(Deflate) compressed files.<br>
However, TIFF files come in many flavours and sometimes the decoding may go 
wrong especially while decoding EXIF information.<br>
It is possible to disable EXIF decoding when reading TIFF files by adding the 
following registry key under <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\DeepSkyStacker</b>: 
SkipTIFFExifInfo (DWORD) with a value of 1.<br>
<br>
If you don't know how to add the registry key, you can download this
<A href="../download/DSS_SkipTIFFExifInfo.reg">small file</A> and double-click 
on it. It will add the registry key for you.</span></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>My FITS Files were created from 
a DSLR and are very dark and without any contrast.<br>
</b>Software capturing DSLR output and storing them as FITS files sometimes use 
the 16 bit file format to store only 12 bit depth images (which is the original 
depth of most DSLR's RAW files).<br>
In this case the values stored in the files are between 0 and 4095 instead of 
between 0 and 65535 which explains why the images are very dark.<br>
You can adjust the parameters in the <A href="userguide.htm#rawddp">FITS Files 
tab</A> in the RAW/FITS DDP settings dialog to correctly see these files.<br>
Simply put you can multiply the total brightness by up to 16 without exceeding 
the maximum threshold. If you modify the white balance by changing the red 
and/or blue scales take care not to go over that 16 multiplier for each channel 
(brightness * channel scale).</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>My FITS Files were created from a DSLR and

</b>You should check that no binning was used by the software making the 
captures. In this case DSS can not use the standard Bayer Filter Pattern of your 
DSLR and this is probably why your images appear all wrong.<br>
The only way is to deactivate binning.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>My FITS files were create by a color CCD

correctly DeepSkyStacker must know which kind of Bayer matrix is used by your 
camera..<br>
You can use the FITS tab of the <A href="userguide.htm#rawddp">RAW/FITS DDP 
settings</A> dialog to tell DeepSkyStacker which Bayer matrix must be used. Most 
of the time you will just have to select your CCD camera from the list.</font></p>

names with, for each file, its type (light, dark, flat, offset) and its status 
(checked or unchecked).<br>
You should note that when a File List is loaded the list containing all the 
files is not cleared.<br>
Thus it is possible to have a File List with all the dark frames, another with 
the flat frames, a third with the master offset and to load all the File Lists 
in one operation.<br>

</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
Multiple sets of stars is a sure sign that the alignment process is relying on 
"false" stars.<br>
The main reason is that hot pixels are perturbing the registering process and 
thus are creating false stars.<br>
You can try to automatically detect hot pixels (see Registering Options) or, 
much better, load and check your dark frames before starting the registering 
process.<br>
All checked dark, flat and offsets frames will be applied to each light frame 
before the registering process guaranteeing that no hot pixels or artefact will 
perturb the star detection which will be much better and accurate. </span></p>

</b>Besides the obvious answers (faster processor, more memory), the best way to 
speed up processing is to use the non interpolation modes (<A href="technical.htm#bayerdrizzle">Bayer 
Drizzle and Super Pixel</A>) or the bilinear and AHD interpolations which are all working only on the raw files with only 
one monochrome 16 bits channel instead of 3 RGB channels.<br>
The picture decoding is faster (fast or no interpolation), the required memory is 
divided by 3 and flat, dark and offset frames are computed and internally stored with only 
one plane instead of 3.<br>
<br>
Another way to get the resulting image faster is to use a

</b>To check that a new version is available DeepSkyStacker connects to the 
website at startup and compare the currently used version with the downloadable 
version.<br>
DeepSkyStacker does not send any personal information to the website or 
anywhere else during this process. It just downloads a very small file 
containing the necessary information.</font></p>
