## Changes in 1.79.0

* Added `boost::throw_with_location`, a more lightweight alternative of
  `BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION` for programs that do not use Boost.Exception.

## Changes in 1.73.0

* Added an overload of `throw_exception` that takes a `boost::source_location`
  object.

NOTE: Projects using `BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION` with exceptions disabled will need
      to add a definition of this new overload.
