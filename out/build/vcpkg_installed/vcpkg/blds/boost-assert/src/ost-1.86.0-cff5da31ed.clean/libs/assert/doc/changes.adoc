## Changes in 1.79.0

* `source_location().file_name()` and `source_location().function_name()`
  now return `""` instead of `"(unknown)"`.
* Added a `source_location` constructor from `std::source_location`.
* Changed `BOOST_CURRENT_LOCATION` to more closely match the behavior of
  `std::source_location::current()`, such as being usable at top level or
  as a default function argument.

## Changes in 1.78.0

* Added `source_location::to_string`.

## Changes in 1.73.0

* Added `source_location`.
