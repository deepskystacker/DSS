The file compress.c contains (slightly modified) source code that
originally came from gzip-1.2.4, copyright (C) 1992-1993 by Jean-loup
Gailly.  This gzip code is distributed under the GNU General Public
License and thus requires that any software that uses the CFITSIO
library (which in turn uses the gzip code) must conform to the
provisions in the GNU General Public License.  A copy of the GNU
license is included at the beginning of compress.c file.

Similarly, the file wcsutil.c contains 2 slightly modified routines
from the Classic AIPS package that are also distributed under the GNU
General Public License.

Alternate versions of the compress.c and wcsutil.c files (called
compress_alternate.c and wcsutil_alternate.c) are provided for users 
who want to use the CFITSIO library but are unwilling or unable to
publicly release their software under the terms of the GNU General
Public License.   These alternate versions contains non-functional
stubs for the file compression and uncompression routines and the
world coordinate transformation routines used by CFITSIO.  Replace the
file `compress.c' with `compress_alternate.c' and 'wcsutil.c' with
'wcsutil_alternate.c before compiling the CFITSIO library.  This will
produce a version of CFITSIO which does not support reading or writing
compressed FITS files, or doing image coordinate transformations, but
is otherwise identical to the standard version.
