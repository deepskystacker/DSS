  LittleCMS 1.16 - Installation guide


  Configuration
  *************
 
  All configuration is done by the configure script on linux. 
  
  If you want to fine-tune the library, this can be done by
  editing lcms.h

  Normally, there is no need to touch anything. Only make sure
  to set properly the NON_WINDOWS toggle if you are using the 
  engine in non MS-Windows environments (set by default), and 
  USE_BIG_ENDIAN if your machine does use this convention. 
  Remaining toggles does control optimization degree. If your 
  compiler does support the new __int64 or "long long" type, 
  (gcc does) you can gain speed by defining the USE_INT64 toggle.
  There is an experimetal multi-threading mode which may be 
  activated by uncommenting USE_PTHREADS toggle. However, this
  is only for completness sake as the current code should be 
  thread-safe on all but a very small fraction of time. So, use
  the toggle only if you make _extensive_ use of threads on 
  multiprocessor architectures.
  

  Installation 
  *************

  Linux/Mac/unices
  ================

  Unpack & untar the tarball (you already did!) and then type 

    ./configure
    make
    make check

  This latter will run the testbed program as well. If you want to 
  install the package, type 

    make install

  This does copy lcms.h and icc34.h into /usr/local/include and 
  liblcms.a into /usr/local/lib

  There is also a simple, old version compatible script. If you 
  experience any problem with automake try this one:

	make -f makefile.simple

  this is just to keep compatibility with old versions.


  For cleaning object and binaries files type 'make clean'

  There are these targets on Makefile:

      install: Does install package
      check:   builds and executes testbed program
      clean:   Deletes object & binary files


  NOTE:  The package doesn't build with srcdir!=builddir
  That is  because a pre-generated icc34.h located at 
  'include' folder. This is needed for windows installs. 
  So, if you plan to build the package using any builddir 
  different from srcdir, please delete this file.
  


  Windows
  =======

  There are projects for most popular environments in the 
  'Projects' folder. Just locate which one you want to use.
    


  Tifficc & jpegicc
  =================
  automake will try to detect whatever you have libtiff and
  libjpeg and if found build these additional utilities.

  Only if you are using makefile.simple:

  If you have libz, libtiff and libjpeg installed, there are
  some additional utilities for converting images using icc profiles.
  Since lcms doesn't require these libraries to work, and in order
  to minimize the dependency carrousel, these utilities are not builded 
  by default. If you want to build them, type 'make utils'. I will
  recommend to give a try if you are interested in color management. 
  tifficc can do wonderful things like converting CMYK separations
  to displayable files and other interesting stuff. Run the executable
  without parameters to see how it works.


  Removing //-C++ style comments
  ==============================

  There is a utility on root called 'filter.c' If your compiler
  doesn't support C++-style comments, apply this filter to all
  source & headers. Probably you would need to make your own 
  compilation script too. I will love! to know any exotic environment
  using lcms, so please me know if it worked.
