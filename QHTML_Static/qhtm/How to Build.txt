How to build QHTM
=================
In these instruction replace <drive:> with the drive letter where you will
build QHTM.
e.g. If my main drive is "C:" then
	"<drive:>\projects"
becomes
	"c:\projects"


Directory Structure
-------------------
My directory structure is as follows, this is detailed in general on my web
site at http://www.gipsysoft.com/articles/project/
<drive:>
    \projects
    \projects\components
    \projects\components\QHTM
    \projects\components\QHTM\Examples
    \projects\bin


* \projects\components
The base of the source tree.

* \projects\components\QHTM
The main QHTM source code is here

* \projects\components\QHTM\Examples
Example projects go here.

* \projects\bin
The LIB/DLL/EXE files are built into the "<drive:>\projects\bin" directory. Building here
means libraries and DLLs can be found.


Each project uses a relative path for linking and for finding header files. Because of this
it should be fairly easy to move files to better suit your needs.


Compiling
---------
To build QHTM open the devstudio project "<drive:>\projects\Components\QHTM\QHTM.sln".

All of the samples can use either the DLL or the static linked libraries. To alter a project
to use the static libraries simply add a #define before the include for QHTM as below:
	#define QHTM_LINK_STATIC_LIBS
	#include <qhtm/qhtm.h>

For this to work you'll need to alter your project settings to specify an additional library
path of where-ever the "bin" directrory is. By default the examples have an additional library
path of:
"..\..\..\..\bin\"



It won't build!
---------------
If you have any problems email support@gipsysoft.com, before doing so please ensure all files
are properly extracted and that every attempt has been made to resolve the problem yourself.


Removing functionality - compiling bits out.
-----------------------------------
* Imaging
To remove some image formats edit 
\projects\components\ImLib\Config.h - Comment out the IMGLIB_* from the #else section to remove
individual formats.

* HTML
\projects\components\qhtm\config.h - Comment out any of the bits you don't want.


Bug reporting
-------------
If you find a bug please send me the minimum needed to reproduce the problem, the smaller the
samples, C++ or HTML, the quicker I will find a solution.

Thanks for purchasing QHTM. if you have any suggestions or queries don't hesitate to contact me.
