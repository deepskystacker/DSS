vcpkg-cfitsio provides CMake targets:

Basic usage is:

	find_package(cfitsio REQUIRED)
	target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE CFITSIO::cfitsio)
	
Notes:
	This is built as a static library.  The Windows build does not use pthreads, 
	so you will need to provide your own locking around use of the library.
